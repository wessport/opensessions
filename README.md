tmux is all you need. make tmux great again :)

`opensessions` is a sidebar for `tmux` when your sessions, agents, and localhost tabs start multiplying.

It lives inside your existing tmux workflow instead of replacing it: one small pane for session switching, agent state, repo breadcrumbs, and quick jumps back into the right terminal.

Built with Rust and [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) for native performance and zero runtime dependencies.

tmux is the only supported mux today. There is older zellij integration code in the repo, but it is not stable enough to document as supported; we are looking for maintainers who want to help bring it back to that bar.

## Install With TPM

Requirements:

- `tmux`
- [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- `curl` or `wget` for downloading prebuilt binaries on first load

Add this to `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'Ataraxy-Labs/opensessions'
```

Then reload tmux and install plugins:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins
```

Open the sidebar with `prefix o → s`.

TPM clones the repo into `~/.tmux/plugins/opensessions`. On first load, opensessions downloads the matching prebuilt release bundle into `bin/`; that bundle includes `opensessions-sidebar`, `opensessions-server`, and `lazydiff`.

If your platform is unsupported or you are developing locally, you can still build from source:

```bash
cd ~/.tmux/plugins/opensessions
cargo build --release
```

If you want the same setup as a single shell command:

```bash
grep -q "Ataraxy-Labs/opensessions" ~/.tmux.conf 2>/dev/null || printf '\nset -g @plugin '\''Ataraxy-Labs/opensessions'\''\n' >> ~/.tmux.conf && tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf && ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins
```

## Update

Use TPM's built-in update (`prefix + U`) or run:

```bash
~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/update_plugins opensessions
```

No rebuild step:

No local rebuild is needed for normal installs. Reload tmux after TPM updates the plugin; opensessions will download the matching release bundle if `bin/` is missing or incomplete.

The plugin automatically restarts the server on update so it picks up the new binary. Toggle the sidebar back on with `prefix o → s` if it was open.

## Uninstall

Run the uninstall script **before** removing the plugin files — it cleans up tmux hooks, keybindings, sidebar panes, and environment variables that would otherwise persist and cause glitching:

```bash
sh ~/.tmux/plugins/opensessions/integrations/tmux-plugin/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Then remove the `set -g @plugin 'Ataraxy-Labs/opensessions'` line from `~/.tmux.conf` and run `prefix + alt + u` (TPM uninstall).

## Today

- Live agent state across sessions for Amp, Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.
- Per-thread unseen markers for `done`, `error`, and `interrupted` states.
- Session context in the UI: branch in the list, working directory in the detail panel, thread names, and detected localhost ports.
- Programmatic metadata API: agents and scripts push status, progress, and logs to the sidebar via HTTP.
- Fast switching with `j`/`k`, arrows, `Tab`, `1`-`9`, session reordering, hide/restore, creation, and kill actions.
- Theme palettes and backgrounds can be chosen independently: press `t` to open the picker, use `←`/`→` to choose a transparent or solid background, then confirm with `Enter`.
- Keyboard-first window management with `W`: inspect pane commands, switch with `Enter`, or mark inactive windows with `→` for reviewed bulk closure without closing the active window.
- `prefix o → s` and `prefix o → t` for sidebar focus and toggle, `prefix o → e` for sidebar-safe `even-horizontal` layout in the current window, `prefix o → 1` through `9` for quick switching, optional no-prefix shortcuts, and in-app theme switching.
- Native Rust sidebar built with ratatui 0.30 and crossterm 0.29, with a local Rust WebSocket/HTTP server.

## Programmatic API

Scripts and agents can push custom metadata to the sidebar over HTTP — no binary needed:

```sh
# Set a status pill on a session
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7391/set-status \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session":"my-app","text":"Deploying","tone":"warn"}'

# Set progress
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7391/set-progress \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session":"my-app","current":3,"total":10,"label":"services"}'

# Push a log entry
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7391/log \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session":"my-app","message":"Tests passed","source":"ci","tone":"success"}'
```

Endpoints: `/set-status`, `/set-progress`, `/log`, `/clear-log`, `/notify`

Tones: `neutral`, `info`, `success`, `warn`, `error` — each with a distinct icon and color.

## Local Development

Build and run from a local clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ataraxy-Labs/opensessions.git
cd opensessions
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

Start the sidebar manually (outside tmux, for testing):

```bash
cargo run -p opensessions-sidebar
```

Start the server:

```bash
cargo run -p opensessions-server
```

For the full tmux workflow with keybindings, troubleshooting, and configuration options, follow the guide below.

## A Few Concrete Bits

- Session ordering is persisted in `~/.config/opensessions/session-order.json`.
- Amp watcher reads `~/.local/share/amp/threads/*.json` and clears unseen state from Amp's `session.json` when a thread becomes seen there.
- Claude Code watcher reads JSONL transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/`.
- Codex watcher reads transcript JSONL files in `~/.codex/sessions/` or `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/` and resolves sessions from `turn_context.cwd`.
- OpenCode watcher polls the SQLite database in `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`.
- Hidden sidebars are stashed in a tmux session named `_os_stash`, so they can come back without restarting the sidebar process.
- Clicking a detected port opens `http://localhost:<port>`.

## Repo Layout

### Apps

- `apps/tui-rs/` — Rust ratatui sidebar client (connects to server over WebSocket)
- `apps/server-rs/` — Rust server that assembles state from mux providers and agent watchers
- `apps/tui/scripts/` — Shell scripts for tmux sidebar launch and session switching

### Packages

- `packages/runtime-rs/` — Shared Rust runtime: tmux provider, agent watchers, config, tracker, protocol
- `packages/sidebar-core-rs/` — Core sidebar state, input, and rendering logic

### Integrations

- `opensessions.tmux` — Root TPM entrypoint for users
- `integrations/tmux-plugin/` — tmux-facing scripts and host integration glue
- `integrations/amp/` — Amp agent integration
- `integrations/pi-extension/` — Pi extension integration

## Current Caveats

- The app is local-only; the default host is `127.0.0.1`, and ports are derived per tmux socket unless explicitly overridden.
- `theme`, `transparentBackground`, `sidebarWidth`, `sidebarPosition`, `detailPanelHeight`, `sessionFilter`, and `mux` are wired through the runtime. `plugins`, `port`, and `keybinding` are parsed for compatibility but are not active runtime extension hooks today.
- Inline theme objects exist in core, but the running server persists and broadcasts theme names.
- tmux is the only supported mux today.
